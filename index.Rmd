I am a Ph.D. candidate in Linguistics at Michigan State University. My research interest is in phonetics and phonology. Some research questions I explore include: 

1. Whether the Sonority Sequencing Principle is phonological or perceptual? 

2. How does sonority affect gestural coordination in speech production? 

3. What is the underlying mechanism of speech production?
